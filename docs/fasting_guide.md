# Patient Fasting Guide

## Do You Need to Fast?

**YES - Fast for 8-12 hours (water only)**

This is the same fasting you'd do for routine cholesterol or glucose tests.

## Simple Timeline

```
8:00 PM  → Eat dinner (last food)
11:00 PM → Bedtime (water OK anytime)
7:00 AM  → Wake up (NO breakfast, water OK)  
9:00 AM  → Blood draw at lab
9:15 AM  → Eat breakfast! ✓
```

## What You CAN Have

### ✅ ALLOWED:
- **Water** (as much as you want - stay hydrated!)
- **Medications** (take with water - ask doctor if unsure)

### ❌ NOT ALLOWED:
- ❌ Food (any kind)
- ❌ Coffee (even black!)
- ❌ Tea
- ❌ Juice
- ❌ Milk

## Morning of Test Checklist

**Before leaving home:**
- [ ] Did NOT eat breakfast
- [ ] Took medications with water (if applicable)
- [ ] Drank water (stay hydrated!)
- [ ] No coffee or juice

**At the lab:**
- [ ] Tell staff what time you last ate
- [ ] Sit quietly for 30 minutes before draw
- [ ] If you forgot and ate → tell them it's "non-fasting"

## Special Cases

### Diabetic Patients
- Consult your doctor before fasting
- May need to adjust insulin/medications
- Early morning appointment best
- Bring glucose meter and snack

### Cannot Fast (Medical Reasons)
- Test can still be done
- Mark as "non-fasting"
- Accuracy drops slightly: 98.8% → 96.5%
- Still very useful for cancer screening

### Keto-Adapted (3+ months on keto)
- You can fast any duration
- 24 hours is fine for you
- Lactate stays low when fat-adapted
- No special preparation needed

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why 8-12 hours specifically?
**A:** This is when all biomarkers are stable. Shorter = food still affecting results. Longer = stress response can raise lactate.

### Q: Can I drink coffee?
**A:** No, even black coffee can affect glucose and stress hormones.

### Q: What if I take medications?
**A:** Most medications are fine with water. Ask your doctor about:
- Diabetes medications
- Supplements  
- Vitamins

### Q: I'm on keto/carnivore - do I still need to fast?
**A:** Standard 8-12 hour fast is still recommended, but you can go longer if needed without affecting results (unlike non-keto people).

### Q: I forgot and ate - should I reschedule?
**A:** Call the lab. They may reschedule or proceed as "non-fasting" (still ~97% accurate).

## Tips for Easy Fasting

1. **Schedule morning appointments** (7-11 AM)
2. **Eat normal dinner** (don't stuff yourself)
3. **Drink plenty of water**
4. **Bring a snack** for after the test
5. **Keep busy** in the morning

## What Happens If You Don't Fast?

| Fasting Status | Accuracy | Notes |
|---------------|----------|-------|
| Fully fasted (8-12 hrs) | 98.8% | Best results |
| Partially fasted (2-4 hrs) | 97-98% | Still good |
| Non-fasting | 96-97% | Still useful |

Even non-fasted, the test is 96%+ accurate!
